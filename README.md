# [ðŸ“Š Interactive Visualizations of Mittelmann benchmarks](https://mattmilten.github.io/mittelmann-plots/)

Some interactive [Plotly](https://plotly.com/python/) graphs comparing the results of [Hans Mittelmann's benchmarks](http://plato.asu.edu/bench.html). Each solver can be selected for pairwise running time comparisons with every other solver in the respective benchmark. The times are compared using shifted factors on a logarithmic scale. Additionally, the absolute times of the selected base solver are also plotted on a secondary logarithmic axis on the right.

These plots should make browsing the results easier. Please let me know if you have a question or if there is an error.

Click on the solver name in the legend to enable or disable it in the plot.

Plots are updated daily.
