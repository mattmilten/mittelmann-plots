# [Interactive Visualizations of Mittelmann benchmarks](https://mattmilten.github.io/mittelmann-plots/)

Some interactive [Plotly](https://plotly.com/python/) graphs comparing the results of [Hans Mittelmann's benchmarks](http://plato.asu.edu/bench.html). Each solver can be selected to show pairwise running time differences with every other solver in the respective benchmark.
These plots should make browsing the results easier. Please let me know if you have a question or if there is an error.

Click on the solver in the legend to enable or disable it in the plot.

Plots are updated daily.
